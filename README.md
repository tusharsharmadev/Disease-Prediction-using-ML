# Disease Prediction Model using ML

Welcome to our project repository developed during the Hackathon by Team "The Backbenchers." Our project focuses on disease prediction using Machine Learning techniques, specifically targeting Diabetes and Heart Disease.

## Team Members:
- Tushar Sharma
- Rohan Sharma
- Meet Mali
- VenkatSaigautam Bathina

## Project Overview:

Our project utilizes Machine Learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of two critical diseases: Diabetes and Heart Disease. Leveraging the power of Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn, we've developed accurate prediction models.

## Working of the Project:

1. **Data Collection and Processing:**
   - We gathered relevant medical data for Diabetes and Heart Disease prediction.
   - The data was cleaned, processed, and prepared for model training.

2. **Model Development:**
   - **Diabetes Prediction Model:** Utilized machine learning algorithms to analyze factors like BMI, glucose levels, and family history to predict the likelihood of Diabetes.
   - **Heart Disease Prediction Model:** Employed features such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and exercise habits to predict the risk of Heart Disease.

3. **Model Deployment:**
   - We developed a user-friendly web application using HTML and CSS.
   - Both the Diabetes and Heart Disease prediction models were integrated into the web app.
   - Users can input their medical data and receive instant predictions regarding their likelihood of having Diabetes or Heart Disease.

## How to Use the Web App:

1. **Visit the Web App:**
   - Go to [insert-web-app-url-here] to access our Disease Prediction Web App.

2. **Input Your Data:**
   - Enter your medical information as prompted on the web app interface.
   - Specify details such as BMI, glucose levels, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and exercise habits.

3. **Get Instant Predictions:**
   - Submit your data, and our models will process the information instantly.
   - Receive accurate predictions for both Diabetes and Heart Disease, helping you understand your health risks.
